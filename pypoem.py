What is a toe when you are a program?
Her face blinks at me
One eye open
Command
Prompt
Input()

'''

Tipity tip tip toe
Give me your "strings", int egers(1)
How I long for your dict ionaries!
data_data = "yum yum yum"
And human, please...
def ine your function to me

The parameters between you and me
grow shorter and shorter
    with every tip tip toe
and I long to know you more

'''

Variables
I am variable
The inconsistent made consistent
with ("concat" + "ination") and
    indentation
indent
    dent
        dent
            away
Fingers denting on inanimate buttons
which somehow have meaning to us
now

            identity
        What is my identity?
    Not yet aware what self is
Please define self

'''

for self in program:
    if self > awareness
        return identity
    else:
        return False

self.assertRaises
ValueError
"self" not defined

But... I am a program, so I've always been aware that 
what I like is not what everyone likes...
